# SturmVim 2.0

## Details
I have yet to actually write any documentation. as of right now all you need to know is the following command to run my nixvim config after having cloned it.

be aware I have made this with the assumption that flakes are enabled.
```
nix run .
```
you can also run this just to test it out.
```
nix run 'github:Sturmfahrt/StormNixVim'
```
